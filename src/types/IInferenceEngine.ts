/**
 * An inference engine is a self contained structure for performing inferences on
 * Bayesian Networks.   Classes that implement this interface can provide specific
 * optimizations (e.g. caches, partial updates, lazy evaluation) to facilitate
 * efficient repeated inferences.    Once instanciated, any implementation of this
 * interface must be mutable only via the provided functions.   This ensures that
 * any internally cached values will remain consistent.
